   ~ Cleaning is done by removing empty column, removing duplicates, errors etc.
   ~ Replacing values in column with proper values and naming.
   ~ Detecting data type of every column, using the auto detect data type function in Power query editor.

3. Data processing:

   ~ In the Power Query editor, creating new column called "AttritionCount" by using conditional column feature in add column which is created on the basis of certain condition like (IF 
     attrition = 'Yes' then 1, Else 0).
   ~ This new column is further used for creating different KPI's and charts.Then creating the Attrition Rate by applying DAX queries, adding new measure (Attrition Rate = 
     SUM([AttritionCount]))/SUM([Employeecount])) in %. 

4. Data analysis:
